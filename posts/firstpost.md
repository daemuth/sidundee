## What is social innovation?
Social innovation is a distributed and bottom-up innovation process which offers novel answers to social needs. Social innovation **impact** is connected with improving the quality of living of the people and the possibility for them to satisfy needs which do not find solutions from institutionalised channels. Social Innovation is activated by understanding and closely observing people&#39;s lives while involving and empowering them. By thinking creatively and pursuing simple, sustainable solutions, the quality of life of individuals and communities can be improved.


## About the project
When we decided to launch the project Mapping Social Innovation in Dundee our ambition was to provide a comprehensive mapping of what are the needs and the potential for generating more social innovation in the city. We wanted to offer a window into the potential for generating novel solutions supporting the community and also entice social funders to invest in projects capable of meeting these needs. 

We are now opening the website [sidundee.study](https://sidundee.study/) as the main channel through which we want to communicate and disseminate the results of this project in the hope that this will create interest and bootstrap a wider set of social innovation initiatives.

Social Innovation is of course something which is not entirely new to the city. There have been a number of interesting and relevant examples which have also featured in the news quite recently. Among others we can mention the  [Dundee Community Fridge](http://www.gatechurch.co.uk/communityfridge) or the  [green health prescription](https://www.volunteerdundee.org.uk/our-work/green-health-prescription/). The potential is there for Dundee to become a hub for more social innovation, also taking advantage of recent developments including the V&A and more established dynamics such Digital Games.

The approach we propose places particular emphasis on working closely with various local groups to identify the existing gaps and the forms of social innovation that would benefit them. Theproject, in particular, places strong emphasis on the mapping of the local situation and this will have an impact well beyond the scope of the project itself and has added value for the activities of a range of organisations involved in the delivery and support of social need (such as Charitable bodies). While the present project will not conduct all the phases of an entire Social Innovation cycle, it will cover the initial core steps, which will include: the mapping and a phase of ideas generation with the development of co-design and co-creation activities.

The 3 strands of the project include:

- A qualitative mapping of needs done with qualitative interviews and visits to organisations
- A data science approach to mapping the needs of social innovation, largely based on re-using existing available datasets
- An idea generation phase based on co-design where we would like to start envision some potential solutions to the identified needs

Abertay has extensive experience in digital innovations and in co-design research activities. Abertay was partner and has completed two large Social Innovation projects funded by the European Commission: one for building a web platform for a bottom-up openly accessible database of environmental, social and governmental (ESG) data of companies ([http://wikirate.org/](http://wikirate.org/)) and the second for sustaining novel forms of welfare supporting people who have experienced poverty and unemployment in Europe ([http://pieproject.eu/](http://pieproject.eu/)). Furthermore, Abertay will leverage its world-class expertise in the use of games (digital and non-digital) as a tool for conducting core aspects of the research.
