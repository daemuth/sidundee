How It Felt provides supervised and interactive Puppet Building, drama and film making workshops with an emphasis on mental health and well being. “How It Felt” is a Dundee based social enterprise service run by Director Deborah Chapman. A Duncan of Jordanstone Graduate and where the project began as a short puppet film based on the public expressing themselves and their families affected by ADHD in “How do you see ADHD?”. Through the art of puppetry she facilitates workshops and activities to spread awareness and education surrounding mental health.


Part of this process is doing talks and performances with my own puppet Little Debz to engage, educate and demonstrate the service. Mental health and education surrounding it is important but not always easy to teach or communicate. This is caused by such factors as stigma and issues with how it’s portrayed in the media and lack of support. But we have found it is easier and fun with puppets to engage with anyone and also educate by letting those affected have their say. 

We work mostly within Dundee but have worked in other areas around Scotland. Dundee is known for its poverty and people experiencing various issues in the city and the public demand of services. Dundee has a lot going on creatively and there is always new businesses and charities within the third sector popping up. It’s a privilege to be part of positive changes taking shape and to be part of this community. The business support here has been overwhelming in becoming a social enterprise and it’s been amazing to be able to collaborate and work together.

One story that comes to mind is one of our clients who has used our service a few times now and seems to benefit from it. At the time they were still in school and I was at an event were by chance bumped into a teacher we had worked in the past with and turns out the client was a student of theirs. And that at school they were a mute who didn’t really speak but after bringing their puppet to class with them could now speak through it and communicate more positively. I had no idea that they were mute and the impact our service had till that chance meeting.

I think for every business COVID-19 is impacting everyone financially. Working from home has been difficult to maintain a routine and sometimes good mental health. All of our future events and workshops have had to be cancelled or postponed right up to Summer. We have been doing a lot of work online on providing activities, videos, art communities, and puppetry fun to communicate. We even had an online puppet building workshop with a client which is a first. I do think this will change the way businesses work forever and even how we connect with people, it’s quite historic what is happening. I would rather that we are all sensible and safe during this time.
