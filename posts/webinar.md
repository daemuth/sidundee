On 14th July 2020, MAPSI with support from the social enterprise ‘How it Felt’ organised a talk with third sector organisation members titled ‘Let’s Talk Third Sector Needs in Dundee’.

At MAPSI, we have realised that local social sector organisations may have common issues and challenges in their work, and it would be beneficial for them to discuss their needs with each other.
Moreover, even if the issues might have commonalities each organisation may find a different approach to overcome it; which also might be meaningful to share. Thus, the aim of the event was to bring together third sector organisations and initiate the discussion on current issues they are struggling with. We also had a hope that our participants will learn from each other’s experience or will have some novel insight regarding their own work.
 
Moderated by Nadeen Purna and Olena Saienko, PhD students from the MAPSI project, the talk was attended by Deborah Chapman (Founder and Director, How it Felt), David Dorward (Chair, Dundee Bairns and Associate Director, The Rank Foundation), David Baker (Good Governance/Organisational Development, Dundee Volunteer and Volantary Action), and Michelle Almeida (Business
Development Director, Women’s Business Station). The participation bought together practitioners with over decades of experience in the sector and also members bringing fresh insights to the table.

Keeping in mind social distance restrictions we are limited in organising real-life workshops. However, we have tried this, new for us, online approach. The format of the webinar was interactive
with the focus on participants discussion.

After a short introduction, we invited everyone to participate in ‘post-it’ activity using online collaboration software. It allowed to create a visual overview of current issues and define issues that
are similar for everyone. Moreover, participants were asked to vote for the most urgent issues to see priorities. Among the prioritised themes were:

- Funding
- Collaboration/Cooperation
- Council & Government use of service
- Tech skills
- Awareness

When themes where defined we initiated the discussion and covered two issues: Funding constraints and significance of collaboration, both inter-third sector and cross-sectoral.

Since online format brings some limitations in the initiation of discussion among larger groups of people, we believe that such small-scale event, as we have organised, is the optimal way for leading
conversations right now.
 
The event showed that organisations are interested in similar discussions as it is one form of collaboration in the field or can create a pathway for so. As organisations seek more information about current changes in the local third sector, our project sees the benefit of organising similar events. Workshops and online events can support collaboration, increase awareness and simply inspire people for making changes in their organisations. We believe that bringing organisations together and initiating the discussions is one aspect that MAPSI project can perform to support local communities in this changing time. MAPSI is grateful to all the participants and supporter of the event.
