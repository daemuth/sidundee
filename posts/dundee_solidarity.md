As it neared lunch time, the café started getting abuzz with people. Someone at the door welcomed guests with a smile, while some hurried in the kitchen to ready the food. Soon enough as people settled into tables decorated in quaint gingham covers, flowers and crystals, orders were being taken for the choice of hot soup and rolls. We settled for warm cookies as Linda (pseudonym) would not give up on feeding us —an 80 year old volunteer who has been working in this community café for some 30 years now.

While the food rolled out, the place came to life through what the Scots call a blether with people from a myriad background, ages, and interests: young folks talking about football, moms gathered in a table having a chat as their toddlers played with the volunteers, a big table of pensioners and community workers which only kept getting bigger and louder.

There was one major commonality though. Most of the people in attendance were in ‘need’. ‘Need’— a word that keeps recurring throughout our journey, as we talk to more people; that “there is a need”. A need for food, need for money, need for shelter, for services, for community and bonds, and the need to be heard among many others.

There is the single parent juggling two part-time jobs who has come over to feed their kid, the pensioner who lives alone and cannot quite work out the tech for accessing their universal credit payment, the other elderly who can recount some of Dundee’s has-been jute mill glory days and is now trying to reconnect with society, the young adult struggling with substance dependency and mental health issues borderlining on being homeless now.

Yet, camouflaged within these clusters in the café are also individuals who are there to respond to such needs: representatives from a mental health charity, local healthcare service, housing charity, someone offering children’s support, financial advice, interest-based community activity groups, the list goes on. The stigma of accessing aids is beaten by serving people as done in conventional cafés, all the while offering reliable support options. If the ‘need’ is not addressed by them, they are ready with flyers or laptop to signpost to available alternatives. There may not be an answer for everyone’s needs, but there is an acknowledgement and effort.

The community café in some level mimics Dundee’s third sector scenario as the whole city is marked by a similar perceptible solidarity. Throughout pockets of multiple deprivation1 there are a plethora of such organisations in Dundee that offers support to the deprived, marginalised, and vulnerable. Taking different forms, these local organisations (charities, social enterprises, community projects, voluntary organisations etc.) have been shouldering the task of filling the gaps in provision or working side by side with the traditional sectors to meet the ‘needs’ of its people. The city is home to over 600 charities and over 100 social enterprises, and numerous community projects many yet outside of any known official count. While there is a good bunch of local wings of national and Scottish charities, the majority are grassroots and bottom-up initiatives responding to local issues from within the community. These organisations cater to different often joint issues ranging from multiple fragments of poverty like food, holiday hunger, children, fuel etc., dedicated mental health issues, finance and benefits, strengthening social capital or beating social isolation, community safety and justice to art and leisure, environmental welfare, animal welfare etc.

Much like the community café several such grassroot initiatives risk getting dismissed as just another voluntary organisation. But when looked at closely enough, within the seemingly mundane concepts one would find traces of newness- in the service design, in the delivery, in the way it transforms social and power relations, often so nonchalantly that it misses the purview of the resource providers. It is this gap that the first leg of the research taps into, to bring forth the socially innovative initiatives shaping Dundee’s solidarity.
