            <p>This phase involves a qualitative study mapping in-depth the local community’s most pressing social needs and exploring work of Dundee’s third sector organisations in meeting the unmet needs. This exercise helps bring to the fore how the city’s grassroot initiatives are mobilising socially innovative solutions, and underscores those initiatives’ further resource requirements.</p>
            <p>Support organisations like trusts and social investors are also consulted to obtain a richer picture on the resource gaps. Currently, data is being collected semi-structured interviews following an initial scoping of the field. </p>

            <p>Through leveraging the use of new techniques from the emerging Data Science field there will be extensive mapping of activities across the entire local community. It will support a broad and structured overview of the local activities and needs. The creation of a website for making all the information from the mapping available to a variety of interested organisations and individuals, also comes under this phase.</p>

            <p>In a third phase, initial generation of ideas for Social Innovation will then be conducted. Co-design and co-creation activities will be undertaken in order to support people in designing the social innovation solutions for their needs. We will leverage our expertise in User-Canter design in this process and arrive at a proposition of a portfolio of feasible ideas. Depending on resources, this phase could lead to assessing the feasibility of the creation and trialling of apps//digital technology which address the needs identified.</p>
